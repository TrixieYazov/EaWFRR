 sicameon.166.t:0 "Time is Running Out"
 sicameon.166.d:0 "The years have been cruel to Sicameon and to its rulers. In the past few decades, many elusive problems have begun to rear their ugly heads, posing a challenge to the ruling Regency Council and the nation that hosts it.\\nnFirstly, piracy and illegal trade have strained our economy and caused corruption to fester throughout local governments. An ever-growing number of upstart politicians line their own pockets with bribe money while the average citizen lives in fear of going outside at night.\\nnTo add to this, the popularity of our ruling Regency Council, having previously been uneasy, has recently begun to decay at an alarming rate. Republican parties have captured the hearts of a concerning swathe of the population, which looks increasingly towards revolution due to the uncompromising nature of our rule. The indecisiveness of the Regency Council towards electing a monarch does little to recover the government’s reputation, either.\\nnWe are left with two different possible approaches. The Regency Council should either focus all of its efforts on suppressing dissent or electing a monarch. Although getting a king on the throne may yet prove itself an indomitable task given the situation, it would solve some of our more immediate problems and help get the nation back on the right track. That said, facing our enemies head on would likely prove a less difficult but more risky effort. The choice ultimately falls to the Regency Council, which, in a rare moment of unity, decides…"

 sicameon_frtr.3.t:0 "An Interesting Proposal"
 sicameon_frtr.3.d:0 "With the understandably unique circumstances laid before them, the regency council had gone into a private chamber and had been there a very long time indeed.  It was now day two, and although they had yet to decide who would take the reigns of power, a few notable candidates were now there.\n\nThe first option was perhaps the most obvious, at least according to the best bred on the council. Duke Frederick of Yale-Gamia, the Herzlander. Technically the legitimate heir to the throne, the duke laid claim through his father (who had sold the Duchy of Yaledom to the universities), whose grandfather in turn originally laid claim to Sicameon. Unfortunately, in the modern world claims of legitimacy fall on deaf ears. The vast majority of the country are repelled by his autocratic tendencies and worse yet the populace is disgusted by his wholehearted embrace of Imperial nostalgia.\n\nAnother well-bred option is Tomado of Bronfeld, the crown prince of Brodfeld. Now in exile, he fled his home country after it broke out into civil war between the communists and supporters of his tyrannical and mad father, King Kloseu. His harmonic values are beyond question, most council members have noted the increased animosity and fieryness in his speeches, more than ofter decrying the 'disgustingly decadent political order left behind by the failed Herzlander Empire'.\nRegardless of his extravagant views, the exiled crown prince has established himself as a very charismatic and intelligent figure in his new Sicameonese home.\n\nWhen it comes to politics however pragmatism often wins out, and while there are still disagreements it may be the case that Duchess Giovanna of Wingbardy may ultimately win the day. Closely related to the royal family of Wingbardy and with good connections, she would certainly seek to strengthen ties with Wingbardy and join the Karthinian Pact . Giovanna has,however, absolutely no intention of making Sicameon subservient to Wingbardy, but instead aspires to establish her own powerful legacy.\n\nThe last candidate is Petronilo of Midoria, whose pedigree is the least established – unless you count the opinion of the commoners. His nationalist credentials are well-understood, especially given his concern for the Sicameonese minorities in Gryphus that he aspires to help. Despite his relatively humble origins and curious behaviours, he does have a genuine desire to improve the lot of the common people while strengthening the nation and his rural populist and religious stances differentiate him from the other candidates, to the pleasure of the populace\n\nFinally, the council decides. They pick…"

You were free to meet and discuss plans without the risk of the military breaking in. But still, caution was needed, the location of the meeting was kept secret, a password was needed and everyone knew each other.\n\nThe crowd of republicans all talked and whispered in hushed tones. They wondered what this meeting was about, rumours have been circulated for weeks about a new alliance made by their illustrious leader. But only time would tell if he was here to discuss it. Indeed as the thought of their leader came to mind, the man while took to the stage. Alexis Vidrio.\n\nHe looked upon the Republicans that waited anxiously for his words, the whispers and murmurs soon faded away. They all looked up and waited for him to speak.\n\n“My friends,” he began, “I know these are trying times and I appreciate your patience. But the time to act is soon upon us. We must take the first steps to begin organising for the fall of the regency. Its despotic and imperialist dogma must end, only together can we-”\n\nBefore he could finish, a voice from the crowd yelled out. “We don’t want some empty speech! Tell us the truth!”\n\n“Yeah!” Another cried out, “Is it true? Are we allied with criminals and pirates now?!”\n\n“We are no better than the regency if that’s the case!”\n\nWhat started as a handful of disgruntled voices soon spread more and more. Vidrio sighed, the rumours of an alliance with the known pirate Don Espadarte had been spreading like wildfire. He had hoped not to need to worry about this coming out but now he had no choice.\n\n“What possible reason could we have to-”\n\n“Tell me...how many of you know how to operate a destroyer?” The room was silent. “No one? How many of you can get up enough supplies to supply our men?’ Once more, there was only silence. “And I don’t suppose any of you have a fleet of ships lying around that can intercept their fleet?” And for one final time...silence. “It breaks my heart that we must do this, but regardless of his current occupation Don Espadarte is a talented and experienced admiral. Something we need. I know this is disappointing...but you have my vow...once our republic is secured...I will personally tear Espadarte down, destroy his fleet piece by piece.”\n\nMany of those in the crowd made murmurs of agreement, their confidence restored as he continued to speak.

 sicameon_frtr.16.d:0 "The years have been cruel to Sicameon and to its rulers. In the past few decades, many elusive problems have begun to rear their ugly heads, posing a challenge to the ruling Regency Council and the nation that hosts it.\n\nFirstly, piracy and illegal trade have strained our economy and caused corruption to fester throughout local governments. An ever-growing number of upstart politicians line their own pockets with bribe money while the average citizen lives in fear of going outside at night.\n\nTo add to this, the popularity of our ruling Regency Council, having previously been uneasy, has recently begun to decay at an alarming rate. Republican parties have captured the hearts of a concerning swathe of the population, which looks increasingly towards revolution due to the uncompromising nature of our rule. The indecisiveness of the Regency Council towards electing a monarch does little to recover the government’s reputation, either.\n\nWe are left with two different possible approaches. The Regency Council should either focus all of its efforts on suppressing dissent or electing a monarch. Although getting a king on the throne may yet prove itself an indomitable task given the situation, it would solve some of our more immediate problems and help get the nation back on the right track. That said, facing our enemies head on would likely prove a less difficult but more risky effort. The choice ultimately falls to the Regency Council, which, in a rare moment of unity, decides… "
